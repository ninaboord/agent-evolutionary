Agent:
Sure, here’s a breakdown of the tasks we can perform and the tools you can use:

1. **Read the Data File**: If you need to examine the contents of a data file, there’s a specific function to read this file and retrieve the information contained within.

2. **Access Configuration Settings**: To get configuration settings from a file, there’s a function designed to retrieve and showcase these settings, allowing you to understand how the system or application is set up.

3. **Initiate and Monitor Processes**: If there’s a need to execute advanced processing scripts or procedures, you can use a specific function designed to initiate these processes and monitor their execution.
