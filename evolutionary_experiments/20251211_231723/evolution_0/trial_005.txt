--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To investigate the issue with the server, we need to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Read the Configuration File:** This will help us understand the current settings and configurations of the server.
  
2. **Review the System Logs:** Analyzing logs can provide insights into any errors or unusual activities that might have occurred.

3. **Run a Test Script:** Testing the server can help us identify specific issues or confirm normal operation after examining configurations and logs.

Let me know how you would like to proceed or if there is anything specific you would like to focus on.
