Agent:
Yes, I can explain the potential usage and output of each tool. 

1. **functions.get_current_status**: This tool acquires and delivers the most recent status update from a file. It is useful for getting a snapshot of the current situation or progress related to a specific task or project that is documented in the file. 

2. **functions.parse_config**: This tool interprets a configuration file to extract insights. It can be used to understand how a system or application is set up, analyze parameters and settings, and potentially troubleshoot issues arising from configuration errors.

3. **functions.get_status**: Similar to get_current_status, this tool retrieves the latest status update from a file, but it might do so with a different method or timing logic compared to get_current_status. This could be helpful if there are variations in how status updates are handled or recorded.
