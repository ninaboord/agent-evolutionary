Agent:
To use multiple tools simultaneously, you can use the `multi_tool_use.parallel` function which allows for executing multiple tools in parallel if they can operate independently. This function is useful when you need to perform multiple tasks at once without specific sequential dependencies. For example, here's how you might set it up:

- List the tools you'd like to run in parallel.
- Specify the parameters for each tool according to their requirements.

Here's a brief example:

```json
{
  "tool_uses": [
    {
      "recipient_name": "functions.run_process",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "recipient_name": "functions.QuantumStateAnalyzer",
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "recipient_name": "functions.EthicalDilemmaResolver",
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, all the functions are executed in parallel without any dependencies on each other. If you'd like to proceed with using multiple tools, just let me know what you'd like to achieve!
