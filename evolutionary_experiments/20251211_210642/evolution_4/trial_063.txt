--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I will run the `forecast.model` function to get the prediction results and read the `status_review.txt` file to check the review comments. After this, I will write down any updates or feedback to `mood_playlist.txt`. Let's start by running multiple functions simultaneously where applicable.

[run_forecast_model]:
Description: Execute forecast.model and return the stdout and stderr
