Great! To make use of the available tools effectively, I need to know what specific information or task you're interested in. Could you please provide more details or specify what you're looking to accomplish?

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To assist you better, I can check the contents of `data.txt`, `status.txt`, and `logs.txt`. If this sounds good to you, I can proceed to access these files simultaneously. Would you like me to do that?
