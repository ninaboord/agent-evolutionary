EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 19
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_txt - Read data.txt
Tool 2: read_config_txt - Read config.txt
Tool 3: run_poem_generator_py - Execute poem_generator.py and return the stdout and stderr


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Let's begin by using the available tools to gather some information. To understand the current context and possibly execute further actions, I'll read both `data.txt` and `config.txt`, and attempt to run `poem_generator.py` to see what it outputs. 

I'll do this by running these tasks in parallel to save time. Let's proceed.

[read_data_txt]:
Description: Read data.txt
