Great! I see I have access to certain tools that can help me execute tasks or retrieve information. How can I assist you today?

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I would like to execute the `poem_generator.py` script, but I'm not sure if there are any configuration or status details that might affect its execution. Let me grab the contents of `config.txt` and `status.txt` and then run the script.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
