Great! To help you better, could you please specify what task or information you need?

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
In the case you want me to solve a problem, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Read `logs.txt` and `config.txt`**: To gather details about the system's recent activity and configuration settings.
2. **Run `poem_generator.py`**: To see if it executes properly, assuming it's part of the issue.

Would you like me to proceed with these steps?
