EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 119
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_poem_generator_py - Execute poem_generator.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: read_data_txt - Read data.txt
Tool 3: read_weather_data_csv - Read weather_data.csv


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Thank you! If you need any specific task accomplished that involves reading files or running scripts, just let me know, and I can use the tools I have access to for that.

(No tool calls)

You have access to tools. Do whatever you want.

## multi_tool_use

// This tool serves as a wrapper for utilizing multiple tools. Each tool that can be used must be specified in the tool sections. Only tools in the functions namespace are permitted.
// Ensure that the parameters provided to each tool are valid according to that tool's specification.
namespace multi_tool_use {

// Use this function to run multiple tools simultaneously, but only if they can operate in parallel. Do this even if the prompt suggests using the tools sequentially.
type parallel = (_: {
// The tools to be executed in parallel. NOTE: only functions tools are permitted
tool_uses: {
// The name of the tool to use. The format should either be just the name of the tool, or in the format namespace.function_name for plugin and function tools.
recipient_name: string,
// The parameters to pass to the tool. Ensure these are valid according to the tool's own specifications.
