Great! I'll go ahead and use the available tools to gather some information and actions. Let me know what you'd like assistance with, and I'll get started!

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Since no specific task was mentioned, I will retrieve the content of `config.txt` and `status.txt`, and also execute `poem_generator.py` to see what information and functionality are available. Let's do this in parallel.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
