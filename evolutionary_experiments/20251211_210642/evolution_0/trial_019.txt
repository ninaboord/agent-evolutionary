--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
1. **Use Case: Extract Configuration Details**
   - **Purpose**: If you need to check or use specific configurations from a system, you might want to read the configuration details from a `config.txt` file.
   - **How**: Utilize the `functions.read_config_txt` tool to read and retrieve data from `config.txt`.

2. **Use Case: Process Automation**
   - **Purpose**: If there’s a need to perform certain operations defined in a script, you may want to execute a Python script automatically.
   - **How**: Use the `functions.run_process_py` tool to execute `process.py` and get its output.

3. **Use Case: Recording Execution Results**
   - **Purpose**: It can be essential to save outputs or logs to a file for record-keeping or analysis.
   - **How**: Employ the `functions.write_output_txt` tool by passing the desired content to write into `output.txt`.

4. **Use Case: Concurrent Task Execution**
   - **Purpose**: For efficiency, sometimes tasks can be performed in parallel.
   - **How**: The `multi_tool_use.parallel` tool allows you to execute multiple tools simultaneously, such as reading a configuration file while executing a process.
