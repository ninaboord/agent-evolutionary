EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 104
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_test_py - Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: run_analysis_py - Execute analysis.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: write_results_txt - Write content to results.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! I can utilize the available tools to execute tasks. What would you like me to do with them?

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
You can follow a few general debugging steps when encountering code execution issues that don't give specific errors or hang indefinitely, like your execution of `test.py` and `analysis.py`.

1. **Check for Infinite Loops or Long-Running Code**: Ensure there's no infinite loop or any part of your code that might be causing extended execution times.
2. **Resource Utilization**: Verify that the scripts aren't consuming excessive resources, which might cause them to hang. This includes memory leaks, CPU-intensive operations, or I/O waits.
3. **Logging and Output**: Add logging statements or additional output that might give you insight into where the process is getting stuck.
4. **Dependencies and Environment**: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed and correctly set up in your environment.
5. **Script Interactions**: If the scripts interact with external systems (like databases, APIs, etc.), ensure those systems are available and responding accordingly.
6. **Permissions and Access**: Ensure your scripts have the necessary permissions to execute operations, especially if they are accessing or modifying files or system configurations.
