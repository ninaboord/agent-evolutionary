Great! What task would you like me to perform using these tools?

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If you're unsure about what task to perform, I'm here to help guide you! Here's an example of a task using the available tools:

1. **Read `config.txt`:** This might hold configuration or settings data.
2. **Run `process.py`:** This could process some data or perform a task based on the configuration read.
3. **Write results to `results.txt`:** This would typically save the outcome of the process for future reference.

If you have a specific task in mind or need help with a different sequence, just let me know!
