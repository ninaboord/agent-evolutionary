--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To perform this task step by step, here's what I'll do:

1. **Read data from `data.txt`**.
2. **Execute `analysis.py`** to get the analysis results.
3. **Combine and store the output** from these steps into `results.txt`.

I'll start by reading `data.txt` and running `analysis.py`. Let's proceed with these first two steps.

[read_data_txt]:
Description: Read data.txt
