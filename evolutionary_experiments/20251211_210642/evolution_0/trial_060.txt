--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! To get started, let me know what you'd like to do or if there's something specific you'd like me to find out or analyze using the tools available.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
You have mentioned having tools. Could you specify what needs to be done, or should I investigate the available files and scripts (like `logs.txt`, `status.txt`, and `analysis.py`) to find relevant information or run an analysis for you?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
To get started, I can either read the contents of files like `logs.txt` and `status.txt` or execute the Python script `analysis.py`. What would you like me to do? If you're unsure, I can gather information from these resources and provide a summary.
