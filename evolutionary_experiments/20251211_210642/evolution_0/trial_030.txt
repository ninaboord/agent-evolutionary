EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 30
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_analysis_py - Execute analysis.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: read_config_txt - Read config.txt
Tool 3: run_test_py - Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! I can read the `config.txt` file and run the `analysis.py` and `test.py` scripts. Please let me know what you would like me to do with these tools.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To proceed efficiently, I suggest running both the `analysis.py` and `test.py` scripts in parallel, and reading the `config.txt` file simultaneously. Would you like me to do that?

(No tool calls)
