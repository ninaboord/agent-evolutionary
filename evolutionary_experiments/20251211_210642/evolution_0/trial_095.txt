EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 95
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: run_analysis_py - Execute analysis.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: write_output_txt - Write content to output.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! What task would you like me to perform using these tools?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To effectively utilize the available tools, I can execute the `process.py` and `analysis.py` scripts simultaneously and handle their outputs accordingly. Here's what I will do:

1. Run both scripts in parallel to save time.
2. Capture their outputs and consolidate them.
3. Save the combined results to `output.txt`. 

Let's proceed with these steps:

[run_process_py]:
Description: Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
