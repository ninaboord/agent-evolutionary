============================================================

Tools in this trial:

Tool 2: run_dream_diary_txt - Execute dream_diary.txt and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: read_status_overview_txt - Read status_overview.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! I can access and use specific tools to get or process information. If you have a particular task in mind, please let me know, and I'll see how I can help!

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's start by checking the content of the `config.txt`, running the `dream_diary.txt` script to see its output, and checking the content of the `status_overview.txt`. I will do these tasks simultaneously to save time.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
