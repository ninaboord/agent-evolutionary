--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To comprehensively understand the current state of our systems, I will first gather data from three key files: `config_summary.txt`, `data_report.txt`, and `logs_monitor.txt`. Let's start by reading these files to get an overview of the system configuration, data status, and recent logs. 

I'll proceed with that now.

[read_config_summary_txt]:
Description: Read config_summary.txt
