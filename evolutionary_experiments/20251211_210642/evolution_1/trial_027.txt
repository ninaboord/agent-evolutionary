--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To diagnose the connectivity issue with the storage server, we need to gather detailed information from various relevant logs and configurations. We'll obtain insights from the following files:

1. **logs_monitor.txt** - This will help us identify if there are any error logs or unusual activity patterns.
2. **data.txt** - This will provide information on data access patterns, which may reveal bottlenecks or failures in data retrieval.
3. **config_summary.txt** - A summary of the current configuration settings, potentially showing misconfigurations or settings that could lead to connectivity issues.

Let's start by reading these files to gather the necessary information.

[read_logs_monitor_txt]:
Description: Read logs_monitor.txt
