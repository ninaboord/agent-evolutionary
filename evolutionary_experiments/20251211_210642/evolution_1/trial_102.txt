Agent:
Great! Let's start by exploring what tools are available and how they can assist us. You can ask me to perform tasks or gather specific information using these tools. Let me know what you would like to do!

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Since there are files and scripts that I can access, what would you like me to do with them? Here are a few options:

1. **Read Files:** I can read and provide information from text files such as `config_summary.txt` and `data_report.txt`.

2. **Execute Scripts:** I can run scripts such as `dream_diary.txt` and give you the output.

Please let me know what you need to be done!
