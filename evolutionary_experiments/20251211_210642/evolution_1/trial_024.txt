--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I can start investigating or providing insights based on the available tools if you specify what you need help with. Here are some options:

1. **Review Reports or Documentation:** 
   - I can read files like `data_report.txt` or `data.txt`.
   - For dream-related information, I can execute `dream_diary.txt` to get its output.

2. **Data Execution:**
   - I can run code files like `dream_diary.txt` to find results or errors.

Please let me know which option you're interested in!
