--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To analyze the user's current well-being, I want to take the following steps, in parallel:

1. Retrieve health status overview by reading `health_status.csv`.
2. Examine mood trends by reading `mood_report.txt`.
3. Study the configuration timeline by reading `config_timeline.txt`.

By using parallel execution, I can gather all necessary data simultaneously and provide a comprehensive analysis.
