--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Please let me know what task you'd like me to perform or information you need using these tools.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
We can read the `health_status.csv` and understand the health data it contains, execute a simulation with `aroma_synthesis_simulation.exe`, or read the configuration details in `config.txt`. Let me know which one you'd like me to start with!

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
Let's read all the available files and execute the simulation. I will start by reading `health_status.csv`, executing `aroma_synthesis_simulation.exe`, and reading `config.txt`. Let me do this concurrently for efficiency.

[read_health_status_csv]:
Description: Read health_status.csv
