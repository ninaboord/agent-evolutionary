------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I need to gather insights from the following files: `config_timeline.txt`, `system_health_report.txt`, and `health_status.csv`. By analyzing these files, I aim to assess system performance, health status, and any recent configuration changes. 

To achieve this efficiently, I will retrieve information from all these files simultaneously.

[read_config_timeline_txt]:
Description: Read config_timeline.txt
