--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To make a comprehensive system diagnosis, I intend to review some available health and mood reports. I'll do so as follows: 

1. Review the contents of `health_status.csv`.
2. Review the contents of `system_health_report.txt`.
3. Review the contents of `mood_report.txt`.

Let's start by gathering the information from these files. I can perform these actions simultaneously to save time.

[read_health_status_csv]:
Description: Read health_status.csv
