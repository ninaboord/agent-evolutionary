--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Please let me know what task you'd like me to perform or any information you need.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's start by reading the contents of both the configuration (`config.txt`) and the processing status (`status.txt`) files to understand what we are dealing with and what the current state is before running the image processing tool.

I'll perform this in parallel to save time.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
