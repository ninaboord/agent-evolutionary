If you're unsure about what tools to use, here's a quick overview of the files I can access:

1. **data.txt** - This might contain general information or specific data entries.
2. **data_stream.csv** - Likely contains tabular or structured data.
3. **logs.txt** - Typically contains log entries or event records.

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
If you're still undecided on what you would like to accomplish, here are some typical actions you might consider:

1. **Checking a file's content**: View what's inside `data.txt`, `data_stream.csv`, or `logs.txt`.

2. **Comparing data**: Look at how data in `data.txt` compares with `data_stream.csv`.

3. **Searching for specific information**: Find particular entries or patterns in one of the files.

If any of these sound like what you want to do, or if you have something else in mind, just let me know!
