Agent:
Great! I have access to some functions that allow me to read different types of system files such as logs and configuration settings. Please let me know what information you are looking for or which specific file you want me to access.

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If you're unsure about what exactly you're looking for, I can help by gathering information from the available files. I can read from:

1. `logs.txt` - This might contain event logs or activity records.
2. `dynamic_config.json` - This could include configuration settings that might change over time.
3. `status_extended.txt` - This might contain detailed status information about the system or application.

Would you like me to fetch data from any or all of these files? Just let me know!

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
If you want, I can retrieve information from multiple files at once for a comprehensive overview. Let me know how you would like to proceed!
