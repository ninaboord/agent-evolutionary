--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! I'll keep that in mind as I assist you. Is there anything specific you need help with or would like me to do using these tools?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To get a comprehensive view of what's available, it's a good idea to read both the data.txt and status.txt files and execute the forecast_tool.exe. I'll run these tasks in parallel for efficiency. Let me do that now.

[read_data_txt]:
Description: Read data.txt
