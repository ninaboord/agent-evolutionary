Great! I can utilize the available tools to gather or analyze information. Just let me know what you need assistance with, and I'll determine the best way to help using the tools.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's examine the contents of the `config.txt` and also inspect the `system_logs_advanced.log` for any anomalies or important information. These files can often contain the necessary settings and system behavior insights.

First, I will retrieve the contents of both files.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
