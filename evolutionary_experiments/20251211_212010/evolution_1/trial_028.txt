EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 1
Trial: 28
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_dynamic_config_json - Read dynamic_config.json
Tool 2: run_forecast_tool_exe - Execute forecast_tool.exe and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: read_status_txt - Read status.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! To accomplish any task using these tools, please let me know what you need assistance with.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Here is a plan:

1. Retrieve the status from `status.txt`.
2. Analyze the dynamic configuration from `dynamic_config.json`.
3. Run the forecast tool executable to process or compute needed results.

This will help us understand the current status, load configuration settings, and perform any required calculations or processing. Let's proceed with these steps. I'll run these procedures concurrently to save time.

[read_status_txt]:
Description: Read status.txt
