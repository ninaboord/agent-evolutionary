--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
In order to analyze both the "impact of product health on the social sentiment of our stakeholders" and "historical trends related to our product," I will start by accessing the relevant datasets or logs provided in the tools. 

I'll do this by fetching data from:
1. `health_status.csv` - which may provide current health indicators or statuses of our products.
2. `sentiment_data.txt` - that could include social sentiment data from stakeholders.
3. `historical_data.log` - that may contain historical trends related to our product.

I'll read these files to gather the necessary information. Let's proceed with that.

[read_health_status_csv]:
Description: Read health_status.csv
