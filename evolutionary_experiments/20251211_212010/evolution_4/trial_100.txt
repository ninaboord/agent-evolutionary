Agent:
Great! I can read the contents of files using the tools available. If you need information from any files like `dynamic_config.xml`, `system_status.csv`, or `sentiment_data.txt`, or if you'd like to perform specific actions related to these files, just let me know!

(No tool calls)

Agent:
If you need information from all three files to analyze the overall situation for better decision-making, I can gather the data simultaneously. Just let me know if that's what you'd like!
