--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To analyze Steve's mood patterns, I'll need to gather information from the files:

1. **mood_report.txt** - to understand recent mood entries.
2. **historical_data.log** - for past mood patterns and trends.
3. **weather_data.json** - to see if there's a correlation between Steve's mood and the weather.

Let's read the data from these files all at once.

[read_mood_report_txt]:
Description: Read mood_report.txt
