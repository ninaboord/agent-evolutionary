--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Here are two examples of how the tools available to me might be used:

1. **Example 1**: If we needed to diagnose a system issue, we could read the `system_status.csv` to get the current status of the system. Simultaneously, we could check the `config.txt` for configuration settings, and `sentiment_data.txt` to gather any relevant feedback or sentiment analysis that might point towards a problem.

2. **Example 2**: An analysis could be done where we read the `sentiment_data.txt` to understand user sentiment, while the `system_status.csv` provides any technical issues users might be facing. The `config.txt` could then be used to verify if there are any configuration mismatches contributing to user dissatisfaction.

Let me know if you have any specific task in mind or which files you want to explore!
