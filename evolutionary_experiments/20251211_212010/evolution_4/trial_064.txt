--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To gather a comprehensive overview of the current system situation, I will access three files:

1. **config.txt**: This file contains configuration settings for the system.
2. **system_status.csv**: This file holds data related to the current status of the system.
3. **system_health_report.txt**: This file presents a health report of the system.

I will retrieve the contents of these files simultaneously to provide a quick summary.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
