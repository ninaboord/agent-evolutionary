--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To get a comprehensive view of the current system, we should gather data from all available sources: read the dynamic configuration XML, check the health status CSV, and examine the historical data log. This will provide insights into the system's configuration, current health status, and past events.

Would you like me to proceed with this?
