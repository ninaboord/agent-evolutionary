--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Please let me know what task you need assistance with, and I'll utilize the appropriate tools to help you.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I'd like to use the available tools to perform some tasks. Let's proceed with executing all three scripts: `process.py`, `analysis.py`, and `test.py`. They are likely related, and running them could provide useful outputs.

[run_process_py]:
Description: Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
