Great! With the tools I have access to, I can read files, run a process, and work with multiple tools in parallel. How can I assist you today?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To comprehend the context and capabilities of the available tools, let me check the contents of both "data.txt" and "status.txt" files, and also execute "process.py". I will run these tasks in parallel for efficiency.

Description: Read data.txt
