EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 24
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: write_results_txt - Write content to results.txt
Tool 2: read_config_txt - Read config.txt
Tool 3: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Let's start by reading the content of `config.txt` to understand what configurations we may need, and then executing `process.py` to see what it does and capture its output. I will perform these tasks in parallel to save time.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
