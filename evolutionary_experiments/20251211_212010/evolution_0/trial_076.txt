Great! Let me know if there's anything specific you need help with, or if you'd like me to use any of the available tools for a particular task.

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
It seems there's a file named `test.py` that can be executed, and a `report.txt` file for writing contents. Additionally, `data.txt` is available for reading.

Is there something specific you would like me to do with these files? For example, I can run the `test.py` file, read from `data.txt`, or write a report for you. Let me know how I can assist!
