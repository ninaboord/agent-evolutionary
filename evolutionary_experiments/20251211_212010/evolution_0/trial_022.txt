Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_analysis_py - Execute analysis.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: read_config_txt - Read config.txt
Tool 3: write_results_txt - Write content to results.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! How can I assist you using these tools today?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let me run `read_config_txt` and `run_analysis_py` in parallel, as they can operate independently, and I'll use the results to prepare content for `write_results_txt`.

[read_config_txt]:
Description: Read config.txt
