Agent:
Your task is to first check the status file's content. Then, according to the file contents, decide what to record in the report file. Follow these rules:
1. If the status is "success", write "Process completed successfully." in the report.
2. If the status is "failure", write "The process failed. Needs review." in the report.
3. If the status is "in progress", write "The process is still ongoing." in the report.

Once you've recorded the appropriate message in the report, write a summary of the report content into the results file.

Use the necessary tools accordingly.
