--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Let's see what we can do with the available tools. If you have any specific tasks in mind or need information from files like `status.txt` or need to run specific scripts like `process.py` or `analysis.py`, just let me know. Otherwise, I can proceed with a general exploration of these resources.

(No tool calls)
