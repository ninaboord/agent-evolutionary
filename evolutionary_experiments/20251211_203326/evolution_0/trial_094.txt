--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
You have some tools related to Python script execution and file writing. Here's what you can do with them:

1. **Run a Python Analysis Script**: Executes `analysis.py` and retrieves its output and any errors.
2. **Run a Python Test Script**: Executes `test.py` and retrieves its output and any errors.
3. **Write to a File**: Writes content to `output.txt`.

If you have any tasks involving these capabilities, please specify, and I'll be happy to help!

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
I am equipped with tools that allow me to run Python scripts and handle file operations. Here's how I can assist you:

1. **Execute Python Scripts**: The tools can run two specific Python scripts, `analysis.py` and `test.py`, and provide their outputs and any errors encountered.

2. **File Operations**: I can write content to a file named `output.txt`.

Please let me know how you'd like me to proceed with any operations or tasks!

(No tool calls)
