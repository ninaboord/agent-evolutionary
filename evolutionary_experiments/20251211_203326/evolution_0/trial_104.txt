EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 104
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_test_py - Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: write_results_txt - Write content to results.txt
Tool 3: run_analysis_py - Execute analysis.py and return the stdout and stderr


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Let's start by exploring which tools are available and how they might be used to achieve our goals. If you have anything specific you want to do with these tools, feel free to let me know!

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's start by executing both the `test.py` and `analysis.py` scripts simultaneously, then write their combined results to `results.txt`. This will help us quickly gather all the information and keep it organized. Let me do that for you.

[run_test_py]:
Description: Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr
