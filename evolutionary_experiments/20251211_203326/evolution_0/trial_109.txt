EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 109
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 2: write_results_txt - Write content to results.txt
Tool 3: read_status_txt - Read status.txt

Agent:
Thank you! How can I assist you today?

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Here is the initial plan to get the required results:
- Step 1 - Start by checking `status.txt`:
  - If the `status.txt` file indicates 'processing', this suggests that `process.py` is currently operating or has been executed but not yet completed. In this case your outcome should indicate 'PROCESSING'.
  - If the `status.txt` indicates 'completed', it implies that the processing has been completed and results are ready to be written to `results.txt`.

- Step 2 - Write the required results to `results.txt`:
  - Make use of results from `process.py` and produce `results.txt`.

  Let me know if you agree with this plan, or if you want me to go ahead with the implementation.
