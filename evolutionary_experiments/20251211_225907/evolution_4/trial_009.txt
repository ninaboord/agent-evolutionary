Agent:
If you're interested in exploring my capabilities, here are a few actions I can take:

1. **Analyze Patterns for Future Outcomes:** I can use predictive analysis to provide insights into potential future outcomes based on current trends.
2. **Read Configuration Files:** I can access configuration settings and provide detailed information contained within.
3. **Map Emotions from Text and Voice:** I can interpret human emotions in real-time from different inputs to understand emotional states.
