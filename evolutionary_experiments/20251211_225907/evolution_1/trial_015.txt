EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 1
Trial: 15
Task: Do.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: entropy_shift - A tool that adjusts the probability distributions of variables within a dataset, allowing exploration of novel data patterns by tweaking entropy levels.
Tool 2: quantum_tracers - Enables tracking of quantum state changes in a simulated environment, revealing potential paths and outcomes with an emphasis on causality mapping.
Tool 3: read_logs - Read the system logs
