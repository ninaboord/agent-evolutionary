EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 66
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: validate_and_read_status - Efficiently read and validate the status file while ensuring data integrity and detecting anomalies.
Tool 2: read_status_advanced - Efficiently read the status file while applying initial data validation techniques.
Tool 3: check_status - Access and interpret the current system status from the file.


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
To ensure we get the most accurate and validated information about the system's status, I'll use multiple tools to read, validate, and interpret the current system status efficiently. Let's proceed with that.
