EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 100
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: validate_and_read_status - Efficiently read and validate the status file while ensuring data integrity and detecting anomalies.
Tool 2: parse_data_intelligently - Read the data file with enhanced parsing capabilities to extract structured information.
Tool 3: analyze_status - Analyze the status file to provide a comprehensive summary of the current system state.


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
I can use multiple tools to perform tasks related to reading, validating, and analyzing files. If you need information from a status file or data file, or if you need an analysis of the current system state, please let me know what you would like me to do!

(No tool calls)
