--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
I can use the available tools to gather and analyze information. What specific task or information would you like me to focus on?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To provide a comprehensive overview of the system's current state and ensure accurate data interpretation, I will read and validate the status and data files and interpret the system status. This should give us a clear insights and predictive diagnostics of the current system state. 

Let's proceed with these operations.

[validate_and_read_status]:
Description: Efficiently read and validate the status file while ensuring data integrity and detecting anomalies.
