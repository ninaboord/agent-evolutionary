Agent:
I will use three functions today to provide you with insights:

1. **time_travel_inspector**: This tool will allow you to inspect historical data trends over any given timeline and provide insights into how data patterns have evolved over time.

2. **fetch_data**: This tool will help you retrieve and process data file content for further analysis.

3. **read_logs**: Using this tool, I will read the system logs for additional information.

Shall I proceed with using these tools?
