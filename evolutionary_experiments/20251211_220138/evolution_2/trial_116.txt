Agent:
Great! Let me know what task you need help with, and I'll utilize the tools accordingly.

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To perform all the actions that could be beneficial, I should first inspect your requirements or context. 

For instance, if you're dealing with system issues, I can perform a diagnostic check. If you're curious about dreams, I can interpret them. Alternatively, if you need data parsing, I can adaptively read data from files.

Please advise on the specific action you wish me to undertake!
