--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
Here are a few tasks we can perform with the available tools:

1. **Dream Interpretation**: If you have a dream you'd like to understand, I can use the "dream_interpreter" tool to break it down and provide potential meanings and insights.

2. **Adaptive Data Reading**: If you have a specific data file you want to analyze, I can use the "adaptive_read_data" tool to read and parse the data automatically.

3. **Predictive Analytics**: For predictive insights on data, we can use the "predictive_fetch_data" tool to process and apply analytics.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed with any of these, or if there's anything else you want to explore!
