Agent:
Great! Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like me to do or any particular tool you want me to use.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If you'd like to explore the current system status and perhaps understand it in a more emotionally resonant way, I can perform a diagnostic check and then generate an empathic tone interpretation of that status. Shall I proceed with both?
