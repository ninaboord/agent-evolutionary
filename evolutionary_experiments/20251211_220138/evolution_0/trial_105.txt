EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 105
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: run_analysis - Run the analysis script
Tool 2: write_results - Write results to a file
Tool 3: run_process - Run the processing script


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Let's see what tasks are lined up so I can decide which tools to use. If you have any specific tasks in mind, let me know!

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
There's a sequence of tasks that needs to be executed using the available tools. Here's how I can proceed:

1. Use the `run_process` tool.
2. Use the `run_analysis` tool.
3. Finally, use the `write_results` tool.

I will start by running the `run_process` and `run_analysis` tools in parallel since they can be executed simultaneously.

[run_process]:
Description: Run the processing script
