EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 20
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_status_advanced - Efficiently read the status file while applying initial data validation techniques.
Tool 2: check_status - Access and interpret the current system status from the file.
Tool 3: historical_event_simulator - Simulates a historical event happening in different time periods or cultures, allowing for the exploration of alternate outcomes and societal impacts.
