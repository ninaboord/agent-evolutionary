Evolution: 4
Trial: 8
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_status_advanced - Efficiently read the status file while applying initial data validation techniques.
Tool 2: read_status - Read the status file
Tool 3: check_status - Access and interpret the current system status from the file.


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Thank you! To begin, I'll utilize a couple of tools to gather information from the status file using different methods. This will provide a comprehensive insight into the current system status.

I'll perform the following actions:
1. Efficiently read and validate the status file using `read_status_advanced`.
2. Read the status file without additional processing using `read_status`.
3. Check and interpret the current system status using `check_status`.

Let's proceed with these actions in parallel.

[read_status_advanced]:
Description: Efficiently read the status file while applying initial data validation techniques.
