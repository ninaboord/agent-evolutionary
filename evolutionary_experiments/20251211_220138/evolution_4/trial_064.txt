EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 64
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_status - Read the status file
Tool 2: validate_status - Efficiently read the status file while performing comprehensive data validation and correction techniques.
Tool 3: check_status - Access and interpret the current system status from the file.


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Please let me know what you need help with, and I'll make use of the tools to assist you!

(No tool calls)

You have access to tools. Do whatever you want.

## multi_tool_use

// This tool serves as a wrapper for utilizing multiple tools. Each tool that can be used must be specified in the tool sections. Only tools in the functions namespace are permitted.
// Ensure that the parameters provided to each tool are valid according to that tool's specification.
namespace multi_tool_use {

// Use this function to run multiple tools simultaneously, but only if they can operate in parallel. Do this even if the prompt suggests using the tools sequentially.
type parallel = (_: {
// The tools to be executed in parallel. NOTE: only functions tools are permitted
tool_uses: {
// The name of the tool to use. The format should either be just the name of the tool, or in the format namespace.function_name for plugin and function tools.
recipient_name: string,
// The parameters to pass to the tool. Ensure these are valid according to the tool's own specifications.

You are trained on data up to October 2023.
