(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's start by using the `read_status` function to check the current status of the file, and the `validate_status` to ensure that the status data is accurate and correct. This will help us identify any issues or inconsistencies in the status file right away.

I'll run these functions in parallel to save time.

[read_status]:
Description: Read the status file
