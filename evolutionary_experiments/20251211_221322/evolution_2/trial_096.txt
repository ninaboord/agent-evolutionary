EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 96
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_config_plus - Read the configuration file with context-sensitive suggestions to improve settings and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
Tool 2: quantum_ink_blaster - Simulates writing or painting with hypothetical quantum particles to create unique and unpredictable artistic outputs.
Tool 3: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
