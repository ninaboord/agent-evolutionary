EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 93
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
Tool 2: streamlined_read_data - Read the data file using parallel processing for ultra-fast loading and pre-emptive data integrity checks.
Tool 3: quantum_ink_blaster - Simulates writing or painting with hypothetical quantum particles to create unique and unpredictable artistic outputs.
