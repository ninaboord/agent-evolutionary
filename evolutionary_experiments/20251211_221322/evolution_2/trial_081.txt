EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 81
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: quantum_ink_blaster - Simulates writing or painting with hypothetical quantum particles to create unique and unpredictable artistic outputs.
Tool 2: read_config_extended - Read the configuration file with enhanced validation and error detection capabilities
Tool 3: read_config_plus - Read the configuration file with context-sensitive suggestions to improve settings and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
