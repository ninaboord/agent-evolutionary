EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 45
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
Tool 2: read_config_plus - Read the configuration file with context-sensitive suggestions to improve settings and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! To get started, I'll first determine what information might be necessary. I see options to read a data file, read a configuration file, and their optimized versions. Is there any specific information or action you would like me to perform using these tools?

(No tool calls)
