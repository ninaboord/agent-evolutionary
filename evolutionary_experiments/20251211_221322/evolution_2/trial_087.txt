EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 87
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_config_intelligent - Read the configuration file with AI-based anomaly detection to identify potential misconfigurations.
Tool 2: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
Tool 3: read_data_enhanced - Read the data file with seamless cloud integration, allowing dynamic scaling and real-time data updates.
