EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 90
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: streamlined_read_data - Read the data file using parallel processing for ultra-fast loading and pre-emptive data integrity checks.
Tool 2: read_config_plus - Read the configuration file with context-sensitive suggestions to improve settings and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
Tool 3: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
