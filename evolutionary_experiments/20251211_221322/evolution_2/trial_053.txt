EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 53
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: quantum_ink_blaster - Simulates writing or painting with hypothetical quantum particles to create unique and unpredictable artistic outputs.
Tool 2: read_config_intelligent - Read the configuration file with AI-based anomaly detection to identify potential misconfigurations.
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file
