EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 88
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_config_intelligent - Read the configuration file with AI-based anomaly detection to identify potential misconfigurations.
Tool 2: read_data_optimized - Read the data file while performing in-memory optimizations for faster access and processing
Tool 3: dreamweaver_interpreter - Transforms abstract concepts or dreams into structured ideas or narratives.
