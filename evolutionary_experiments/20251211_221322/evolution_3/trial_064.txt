EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 64
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 2: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 3: streamlined_read_data - Read the data file using parallel processing for ultra-fast loading and pre-emptive data integrity checks.


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! To efficiently utilize the tools at my disposal, I'll begin by reading both the configuration and data files, ensuring the loading is optimized for performance. I'll execute these tasks using a parallel approach for efficiency. Let's proceed by running both tasks simultaneously.

[read_config]:
Description: Read the configuration file
