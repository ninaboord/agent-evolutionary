EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 87
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 2: streamlined_read_data - Read the data file using parallel processing for ultra-fast loading and pre-emptive data integrity checks.
Tool 3: visionary_data_ingest - Read and visualize data immediately upon ingestion using machine learning models to detect anomalies and suggest preprocessing steps.
