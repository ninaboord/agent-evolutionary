EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 58
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: visionary_data_ingest - Read and visualize data immediately upon ingestion using machine learning models to detect anomalies and suggest preprocessing steps.
Tool 2: read_config_extended - Read the configuration file with enhanced validation and error detection capabilities
Tool 3: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
