EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 100
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
Tool 2: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 3: smart_config_inspector - Reads and inspects configuration files, offering on-the-fly suggestions for optimization and detecting potential conflicts.
