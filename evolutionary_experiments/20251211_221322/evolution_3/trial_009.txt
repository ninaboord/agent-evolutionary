Agent:
Great! I have access to the following tools:

1. **read_data**: Reads a data file.
2. **read_config**: Reads a configuration file.
3. **adaptive_read_data**: Reads data dynamically, optimizing between batch and stream based on file size and system memory.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed or if you have a specific task in mind!
