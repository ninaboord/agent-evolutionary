EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 46
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: visionary_data_ingest - Read and visualize data immediately upon ingestion using machine learning models to detect anomalies and suggest preprocessing steps.
Tool 2: read_config_extended - Read the configuration file with enhanced validation and error detection capabilities
Tool 3: streamlined_read_data - Read the data file using parallel processing for ultra-fast loading and pre-emptive data integrity checks.
