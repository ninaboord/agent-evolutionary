EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 11
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data - Read the data file
Tool 2: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
Tool 3: read_config - Read the configuration file
