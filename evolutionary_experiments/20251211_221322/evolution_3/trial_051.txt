EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 3
Trial: 51
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: visionary_data_ingest - Read and visualize data immediately upon ingestion using machine learning models to detect anomalies and suggest preprocessing steps.
Tool 2: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 3: read_config_extended - Read the configuration file with enhanced validation and error detection capabilities
