Great! Let's review the tools I have at my disposal:

1. **write_results** - This tool allows me to write results to a file.
2. **read_config** - This allows me to read a configuration file.
3. **run_process** - This tool enables me to run a processing script.

If you have a specific task or sequence in mind that involves these tools, please let me know so I can assist you efficiently!

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
In fact, I am set to utilize the tools. Here is a plan involving them:

1. **Read the Configuration File**: I will start by reading the configuration file to understand the settings or parameters needed for the processing task.

2. **Run the Process**: After obtaining the necessary configuration details, I will run the processing script that may depend on these settings.

3. **Write Results to a File**: Once the processing is complete, I will write the results to a file for record-keeping or further analysis.

Should I execute this plan?
