Agent:
Great! To proceed, I'll need some context or a specific task you'd like me to undertake using these tools. Could you please provide more details or specify what you want to do?

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To process the system logs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Read the system logs**: This will give us necessary information about the system's activities.
2. **Run the processing script**: Normally used to analyze or format the logs into a specific structure or to extract certain information.
3. **Write a report**: Based on the processed logs, a report will be generated and saved to a file.

These steps can be automated efficiently by using the tools we have. I'll start by reading the logs and running the processing script simultaneously to save time. Let's do that first.

[read_logs]:
Description: Read the system logs
