Great! I have access to tools that can run a processing script, read a data file, and write a report to a file. If there's anything specific you need help with, feel free to let me know!

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If we need to process some data, read the results, and then write a report, I can efficiently execute those tasks. Should we proceed with running the processing script and reading the data simultaneously?
