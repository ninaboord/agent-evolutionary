EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 4
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 2: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file

--- Iteration 3 ---

Agent:
I'm ready to assist you! Please let me know what you'd like to do, and I can use the available tools to help with your request.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 4 ---

Agent:
I can read both the configuration and data files, potentially with enhanced processing to suggest corrections for any semantic errors. Would you like me to proceed with that?
