EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 101
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
Tool 2: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 3: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
