EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 71
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.
Tool 2: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
Tool 3: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
