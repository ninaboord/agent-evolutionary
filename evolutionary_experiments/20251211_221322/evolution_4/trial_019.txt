EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 19
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: future_vision_incubator - This tool allows the AI to simulate and explore potential future outcomes based on current data and hypothetical scenarios. It leverages predictive algorithms and statistical models to visualize multiple future trajectories and their relative probabilities.
Tool 2: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 3: read_config - Read the configuration file
