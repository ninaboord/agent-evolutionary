EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 5
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
Tool 2: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Let me know what task or information you need assistance with, and I'll use the available tools to help you.

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To efficiently obtain the configuration and data files, we can use multiple tools in parallel. Here's how it will be done:

1. Utilize the `read_config` tool to read the configuration file.
2. Utilize the `adaptive_hybrid_data_reader` tool to read the data file using an advanced data reader method.

Let's perform these tasks simultaneously.

[read_config]:
Description: Read the configuration file
