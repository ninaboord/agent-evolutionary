EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 24
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 2: future_vision_incubator - This tool allows the AI to simulate and explore potential future outcomes based on current data and hypothetical scenarios. It leverages predictive algorithms and statistical models to visualize multiple future trajectories and their relative probabilities.
Tool 3: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
