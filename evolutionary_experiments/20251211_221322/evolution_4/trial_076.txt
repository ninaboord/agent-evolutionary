EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 76
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
Tool 2: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
Tool 3: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's go ahead and use all three tools provided to us. This will help us demonstrate their capabilities: using them in parallel.

[adaptive_hybrid_data_reader]:
