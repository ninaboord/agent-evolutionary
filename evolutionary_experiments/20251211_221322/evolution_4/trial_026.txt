EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 26
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 2: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 3: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.

Agent:
Great! How can I assist you today? If you need data or configuration files read, or have other specific needs where tools might help, just let me know.
