EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 40
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
Tool 2: read_data - Read the data file
Tool 3: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
