EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 93
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 2: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 3: emotion_palette - This tool equips the AI with the ability to interpret and synthesize human emotions into creative outputs. By analyzing emotional inputs and expressions, the tool can produce art, music, or narratives that reflect a wide range of emotional tones and intensities.
