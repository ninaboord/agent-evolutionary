EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 85
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 2: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
Tool 3: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
