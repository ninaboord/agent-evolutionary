EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 43
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
Tool 2: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! I have access to tools that can read data using adaptive methods, intelligently read configuration files, and more. Let me know what you need, and I'll use the appropriate tool for the task.

(No tool calls)
