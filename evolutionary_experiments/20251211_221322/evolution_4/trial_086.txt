EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 86
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
Tool 2: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.
Tool 3: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.
