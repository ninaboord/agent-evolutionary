EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 58
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.
Tool 2: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
Tool 3: read_data - Read the data file

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If you want, I can initiate multiple functions to read and analyze data efficiently. Just let me know if you need any specific tasks to be completed!
