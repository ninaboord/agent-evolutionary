EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 10
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: parallel_config_reader - Utilizes parallel processing to read configuration files swiftly while running concurrent semantic checks to ensure proper syntax and semantics.
Tool 2: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 3: read_config - Read the configuration file
