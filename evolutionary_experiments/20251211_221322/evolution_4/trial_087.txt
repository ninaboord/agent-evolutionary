EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 87
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: adaptive_hybrid_data_reader - An advanced data reader that dynamically chooses between batch, stream, or hybrid methods based on detailed environmental analysis and predicted workload for maximum efficiency.
Tool 2: smart_read_config - Intelligently read the configuration file with adaptive error-correction and auto-suggestions for deprecated parameters.
Tool 3: adaptive_read_data - Dynamically adjusts the data reading method (batch/stream) based on file size and system memory for optimal performance.

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
If you want to optimize data processing, especially with large data sets or configurations, I can utilize a combination of advanced tools to perform tasks like reading configuration files adaptively, choosing the best data reading method, and offering hybrid data reading solutions. Let me know if you want me to proceed with a specific task or a combination of tasks!
