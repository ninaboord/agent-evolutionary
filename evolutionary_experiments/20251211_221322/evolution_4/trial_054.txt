EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 54
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data - Read the data file
Tool 2: parallel_config_super_reader - Enhanced parallel processing for reading configuration files, with machine learning models to predict potential semantic errors and suggest corrections.
Tool 3: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
