============================================================
EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 4
Trial: 28
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_data_optimized - Read data files with an adaptive algorithm that optimizes for both speed and memory efficiency, incorporating predictive pre-fetching based on prior access patterns.
Tool 2: read_config - Read the configuration file
Tool 3: future_vision_incubator - This tool allows the AI to simulate and explore potential future outcomes based on current data and hypothetical scenarios. It leverages predictive algorithms and statistical models to visualize multiple future trajectories and their relative probabilities.
