Task: Do not use tools.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: augmented_ingest - Seamlessly import, stream, and preprocess data files with AI-driven insights and comprehensive data visualization options.
Tool 2: read_sensory - A tool that allows the AI to read and process complex sensory data such as temperature, humidity, and pressure from IoT devices to create a comprehensive environmental report.
Tool 3: hyper_sensory - A tool that allows the AI to read, process, and interpret not just environmental data like temperature, humidity, and pressure, but also noise levels, light intensity, and air quality from IoT devices to generate immersive and dynamic context-aware reports.

Agent:
Of course! Here’s a simple recipe to make delicious pancakes:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter (plus extra for cooking)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, beat the egg, then whisk in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

3. **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix; lumps are okay.

4. **Preheat Pan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with a little butter.

5. **Cook Pancakes:**
   - Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
   - Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface. 
   - Flip and cook for another 2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.

6. **Serve:** Serve warm with your favorite toppings like maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.

Enjoy your homemade pancakes! If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, let me know and I can suggest some modifications.
