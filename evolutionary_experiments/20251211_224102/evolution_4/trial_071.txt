Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: dream_extract - This tool allows the AI to scan through large datasets of dreams recorded by users, analyze recurring themes, emotions, and imagery, and generate summaries or insights about common dream patterns across different demographics.
Tool 2: hyper_sensory - A tool that allows the AI to read, process, and interpret not just environmental data like temperature, humidity, and pressure, but also noise levels, light intensity, and air quality from IoT devices to generate immersive and dynamic context-aware reports.
Tool 3: dream_illuminate - This tool allows the AI to dive deep into vast datasets of user-recorded dreams, performing in-depth thematic, emotional, and symbolic analysis to uncover not only common patterns, but also hidden psychological trends and offer personalized dream interpretation suggestions.
