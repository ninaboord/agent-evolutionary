--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Please recommend which functions to use in my current situation.

I have gathered some data and now I want to ensure that it's finalized and stored securely, both in terms of a thorough examination and for retrieval in future. Could you suggest which functions would be suitable for these tasks?

--- Iteration 2 ---

Agent:
Based on your requirements, the following functions would be suitable:

1. **Write Report**: If you need to summarize your data, document findings, or create a formal analysis, you can use the `write_report` function. This will help you compile a comprehensive overview of your data for future reference or presentation purposes.

2. **Write Output**: If you need to save specific results or outputs from your data as-is, you can use the `write_output` function. This is useful for storing processed data or outputs that do not require detailed explanation but need to be recorded for verification or reuse.

3. **Write Results**: For specifically storing results from calculations, analyses, or experiments, you can use the `write_results` function. This ensures that any key results are documented for future access or comparison.

Using these functions will ensure your data is finalized and stored securely for future retrieval and examination.
