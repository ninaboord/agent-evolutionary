--- Iteration 9 ---

Agent:
To accomplish the task without using tools, you can follow these steps conceptually:

1. **Read the Status File:**
   - Open the status file using a text editor or any file reader.
   - Extract and note any important details relevant to your test.

2. **Read the Data File:**
   - Similarly, open the data file.
   - Analyze the content and extract the necessary data required for your test.

3. **Run the Test Script:**
   - Prepare and run your test script manually using the information gathered from the status and data files.
   - You can use a programming environment or scripting language that you're comfortable with to set up and execute the test logic.

4. **Review and Analyze Results:**
   - Once the test is run, review the results to ensure that everything went as expected.
   - Document any findings or discrepancies.

This method outlines the conceptual steps without the use of automated tools. If you have any further questions or need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!
