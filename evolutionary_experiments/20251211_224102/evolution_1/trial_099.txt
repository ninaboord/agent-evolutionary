Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_status - Read the status file
Tool 2: poetry_fusion - The AI can take a given set of poems or lyrical works, analyze their styles, themes, and structures, then creatively merge them into a new, singular piece while maintaining artistic harmony and introducing potential novel artistic expressions.
Tool 3: dream_extract - This tool allows the AI to scan through large datasets of dreams recorded by users, analyze recurring themes, emotions, and imagery, and generate summaries or insights about common dream patterns across different demographics.
