EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 108
Task: Do not use tools.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: probability_prediction_visualizer - Generates a dynamic and interactive visual representation of predicted probabilities from a dataset, allowing an AI to explore how different variables influence outcomes in a graphical manner.
Tool 2: monitor_logs - Continuously track and parse system logs in real-time with intelligent alert systems for anomalies, performance trends, and security breaches.
Tool 3: decode_data - Dynamically interpret various data file formats, offering previews and highlights of key insights immediately upon reading.
