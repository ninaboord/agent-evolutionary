EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 2
Trial: 57
Task: Do not use tools.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: ingest_data - Seamlessly import or stream the data file with enhanced analytics capabilities
Tool 2: probability_prediction_visualizer - Generates a dynamic and interactive visual representation of predicted probabilities from a dataset, allowing an AI to explore how different variables influence outcomes in a graphical manner.
Tool 3: integrate_data - Flawlessly unify or stream diverse data sources, featuring smart preprocessing, trend predictions, and anomaly detection capabilities.
