Task: Do not use tools.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: dream_extract - This tool allows the AI to scan through large datasets of dreams recorded by users, analyze recurring themes, emotions, and imagery, and generate summaries or insights about common dream patterns across different demographics.
Tool 2: read_data - Read the data file
Tool 3: run_solution_simulator - This tool allows the AI to run simulations of proposed problem-solving strategies in a controlled virtual environment to predict outcomes and optimize the proposed solutions before actual implementation.
