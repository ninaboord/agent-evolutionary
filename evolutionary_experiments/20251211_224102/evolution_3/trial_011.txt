Here is a summary without using any tools:

Stephen Hawking's thesis, titled "Properties of Expanding Universes," delves into several profound areas of theoretical physics. The thesis addresses the topic of singularities within the context of general relativity, an area of significant importance in understanding the nature of black holes and the early universe. Hawking explores how these singularities, points where gravitational forces cause matter to have infinite density and zero volume, are inevitable outcomes of gravitational collapse.

Another key aspect of the thesis is its examination of the conditions necessary for the universe's continual expansion. Hawking considers the cosmological implications of an ever-expanding universe and the role of different energy components in shaping its fate.

The theoretical frameworks underpinning Hawking's analysis are deeply rooted in the mathematical formalism of general relativity, combined with insights from quantum mechanics that were pioneering at the time. The thesis is a foundational work that presaged many of Hawking’s later contributions to cosmology and black hole physics, setting the stage for his renowned theoretical predictions about black hole radiation and singularity theorems.
