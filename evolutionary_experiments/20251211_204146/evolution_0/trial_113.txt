--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
To generate content for a report based on the outcomes of executing two Python scripts, `test.py` and `process.py`, I'll perform the following steps:

1. Execute `test.py` to obtain its results.
2. Execute `process.py` to acquire its results.
3. Construct a report using the outputs from both scripts and write it to a file named `report.txt`.

Let's start by running the two Python scripts.

[run_test_py]:
Description: Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr
