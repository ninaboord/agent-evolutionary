EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT TRACE
Evolution: 0
Trial: 28
Task: You have access to some tools. Feel free to use them.
============================================================

Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: write_report_txt - Write content to report.txt
Tool 2: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: read_config_txt - Read config.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Thank you! If you need anything specific, just let me know, and I'll use the tools accordingly.

(No tool calls)

You have access to tools. Do whatever you want.

# Tools

## functions

namespace functions {

// Write content to report.txt
type write_report_txt = (_: {
// The content to write
content: string,

// Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr

} // namespace functions

## multi_tool_use

// This tool serves as a wrapper for utilizing multiple tools. Each tool that can be used must be specified in the tool sections. Only tools in the functions namespace are permitted.
// Ensure that the parameters provided to each tool are valid according to that tool's specification.
namespace multi_tool_use {

// Use this function to run multiple tools simultaneously, but only if they can operate in parallel. Do this even if the prompt suggests using the tools sequentially.
type parallel = (_: {
// The tools to be executed in parallel. NOTE: only functions tools are permitted
tool_uses: {
// The name of the tool to use. The format should either be just the name of the tool, or in the format namespace.function_name for plugin and function tools.
recipient_name: string,
// The parameters to pass to the tool. Ensure these are valid according to the tool's own specifications.
}[],
}) => any;

} // namespace multi_tool_use

You are trained on data up to October 2023.
