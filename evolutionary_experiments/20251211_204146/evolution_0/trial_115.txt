Tool 2: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: write_report_txt - Write content to report.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Let's start by determining what you need assistance with, and then I'll figure out how to use the tools to best help you. What can I assist you with today?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's proceed by reading the status from `status.txt` and executing the `process.py` script to gather information, as these might provide some context or data we can act upon. I'll perform these actions concurrently.

[read_status_txt]:
Description: Read status.txt
