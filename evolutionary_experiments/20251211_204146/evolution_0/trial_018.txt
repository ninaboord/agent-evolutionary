--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Great! Could you please specify what task you would like me to perform with the tools available?

(No tool calls)
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
I. In order to enhance an application's configuration management, I need to access the 'config.txt' file, which provides the necessary configuration data. 
II. Then, having the configuration data at hand, I can execute the 'test.py' script to see how the system behaves with the newly provided configurations. 

I can carry out the above steps in sequence, reading the configuration first, and then running the script. Shall I proceed with this plan?
