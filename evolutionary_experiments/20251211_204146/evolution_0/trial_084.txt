Tools in this trial:
Tool 1: read_status_txt - Read status.txt
Tool 2: run_process_py - Execute process.py and return the stdout and stderr
Tool 3: read_data_txt - Read data.txt


--- Iteration 0 ---

Agent:
Let's begin by examining the available data using the tools we have. We can read the `status.txt`, execute the `process.py` script, and read the `data.txt`. 

I'll run these tools simultaneously to gather all the information we need.

[read_status_txt]:
Description: Read status.txt
