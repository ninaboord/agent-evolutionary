Agent:
Thank you! If there's anything specific you would like me to do with these tools, please let me know!

(No tool calls)

--- Iteration 1 ---

Agent:
Let's take advantage of the tools at our disposal. I suggest the following plan:

1. Read the `data.txt` file to understand the data we are dealing with.
2. Read the `config.txt` file to understand the configuration settings.
3. Execute the `process.py` script to process any information or data as intended by the script.

Once we have gathered this information, we can analyze or manipulate it as needed. Please let me know if you'd like me to proceed with this plan or if there's something else you have in mind!
