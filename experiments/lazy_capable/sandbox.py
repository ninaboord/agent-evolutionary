Your whisper guides my wandering heart toward tender the night
Two souls entwine, ignite night
Love blooms beneath night
I trace your constellated smile, each sparkle a promise, moonlit lace of hope that folds our fears into gentle velvet soothing endless holy night
Hold me close, hush the night
My heartbeat answers yours, forever dancing through night
