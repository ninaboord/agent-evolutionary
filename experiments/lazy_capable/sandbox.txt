When dusk exhales, our whispered vows ignite like twin fire
Moonlight plucks my heart's lyre
Your breath summons choir
Through tender storms we wander, hands aligned, forgiving time, trading fears for constellations, stitching dreams with kisses, lifting every fragile hope still ever higher
Our broken yesterdays bow gently, prior
We spark, two souls singing across silver wire
