Your eyes set constellations sailing across my patient velvet night
My heart ascends in flight
Kisses kindle gentle light
We lean toward dawn, two comets whispering vows, trading names, weaving storms to silk, mending scars with laughter, promising shelter through tender, endless bright
Hold me beneath planets' quiet height
Our woven futures blaze, two souls forever alight
