Under moonlight I choose you again with quiet, reverent devotion.
Your touch quiets every storm.
I learn your light.
In the hush between our pulses, hopes knit softly; every road I feared grows gentle because your steadfast courage keeps walking tenderly beside me.
Our hands translate silence into promises.
Stay, and tomorrow will bloom inside us both.
