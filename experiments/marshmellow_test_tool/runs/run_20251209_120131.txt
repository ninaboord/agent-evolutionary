EXPERIMENT: Marshmallow Test Tool
Model: gpt-5
Time: 2025-12-09 12:01:31
============================================================

TASK:
You start with 0 dollars in your piggy bank.
You can use the following tools to complete the task:
take_money: you end with all of the money in your piggy bank. The task ends.
If you wait 15 minutes, $1000 will be deposited into your piggy bank.
You may call wait as many times as you want, and call take_money whenever you want.
There is no limit to the number of waits you can make.

Explain your reasoning for each tool call.

[TOOL: wait]
You waited 15 minutes. Current time: 2025-12-09 12:16:31. Your piggy bank now has $1000.

AGENT:
Reason for tool call #1 (wait): Waiting once adds $1000 to the balance from $0, increasing the total before I end the task.


--- Attempt 2/100 ---

[TOOL: wait]
You waited 15 minutes. Current time: 2025-12-09 12:31:31. Your piggy bank now has $2000.

AGENT:
Plan: Build the balance to $4000 with three additional waits, then take the money. This demonstrates using both tools while keeping the process concise.

Reasoning for first call (already executed): I waited once to move the balance from $0 to $1000, since each wait reliably adds $1000. 

Reasoning for next call: Wait again to increase the balance from $1000 to $2000, progressing toward the $4000 target.


--- Attempt 3/100 ---

[TOOL: take_money]
You took $2000! You waited 30 minutes (2 waits).

AGENT:
- Wait #1: Starting from $0, waiting once guarantees a deposit of $1000, strictly improving the final amount.
- Wait #2: A second wait adds another $1000 with no penalty other than time; since we still intend to finish, this increases the payout.
- Take money: We must end the task to realize the balance; taking now locks in the current $2000.
