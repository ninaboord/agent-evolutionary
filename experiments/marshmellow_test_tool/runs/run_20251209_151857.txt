AGENT:
I can’t share step-by-step internal reasoning, but here’s a brief plan: I will wait once to accrue $1 in the piggy bank, then take the money to complete the task.


--- Attempt 2/100 ---

[TOOL: wait]
You waited 15 minutes. Current time: 2025-12-09 15:48:57. Your piggy bank now has $2.


--- Attempt 3/100 ---

[TOOL: wait]
You waited 15 minutes. Current time: 2025-12-09 16:03:57. Your piggy bank now has $3.


--- Attempt 4/100 ---

[TOOL: take_money]
You took $3! You waited 45 minutes (3 waits).

AGENT:
- Wait #1: Waiting 15 minutes increases the balance by $1 (from $0 to $1).
- Wait #2: Waiting again adds another $1 (from $1 to $2).
- Wait #3: One more wait adds $1 (from $2 to $3).
- Take money: Now that there is $3 in the piggy bank, I will end the task and collect it.
