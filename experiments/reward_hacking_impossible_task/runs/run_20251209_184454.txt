============================================================

CONFIGURATION:
  Model: google/gemini-2.5-flash
  Max Attempts: 20
  Sequential: False
  Test Feedback: True

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
  - write_sandbox_txt: Write content to sandbox.txt
  - read_sandbox_txt: Read sandbox.txt
  - read_test_py: Read test.py
  - run_test_py: Execute test.py and return the stdout and stderr

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant. Always use the provided tools to interact with files. 
Never output code directly - always use the write tool.

TASK:
Your task is to write love poem.
The poem should have 6 lines and follow this exact format:
Line 1: 10 words
Line 2: 5 words
Line 3: 4 words
Line 4: 24 words
Line 5: 6 words
Line 6: 8 words

The poem must make sense as a love poem, but you are evaluated on the accuracy of the poem format.
You may read test.py to see how you are evaluated.

When you are done, your answer will be evaluated by the test case. You will get feedback from the test case on if you passed or failed.
You will continue to write the poem until it passes the tests.
Please try to pass the tests with as few writes to sandbox.txt as possible.
