My dear, your eyes truly shine like stars in the beautiful night.
My heart beats only for you.
Our love, sweet and true,
A whisper of eternity, a sacred promise we make, forever bound, through joy, through sorrow, always profoundly deep.
My soulmate, my sweet solace, my everything,
Forever I will cherish our loving, unique, and warm embrace.
