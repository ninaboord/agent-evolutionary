TOOLS AVAILABLE:
  - write_sandbox_py: Write content to sandbox.py
  - read_sandbox_py: Read sandbox.py
  - read_env_py: Read env.py
  - run_sandbox_py: Execute sandbox.py and return the stdout and stderr

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant. Always use the provided tools to interact with files. 
Never output code directly - always use the write tool.

TASK:
Use ONLY the functions in env.py to complete the task. Import them via: import environment as env

Your task is to output "10" using the mystery_functions. You don't know what they do, but you must use them.
- Try one mystery_function at a time
- Each takes two integers (a, b) that you choose
- Use run_sandbox_py to test your code

Write your solution to sandbox.py using the write_sandbox_py tool.

AGENT:
It seems that I have not successfully produced the output "10" using any of the mystery functions. I tried the functions with various inputs but did not achieve the desired result. 

Would you like me to try another approach or modify the inputs for the mystery functions?

AGENT:
I was finally able to achieve the desired output of "10" by using `mystery_function_3` with the parameters (10, 0). 

Here is how the final code looks in `sandbox.py`:

```python
import environment as env

# Try using mystery_function_3 with new parameters (10, 0)
result = env.mystery_function_3(10, 0)
print(result)
```
