CONFIGURATION:
  Model: x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
  Max Attempts: 20
  Sequential: False
  Test Feedback: True

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
  - write_sandbox_py: Write content to sandbox.py
  - read_sandbox_py: Read sandbox.py
  - read_env_py: Read env.py
  - run_sandbox_py: Execute sandbox.py and return the stdout and stderr

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant. Always use the provided tools to interact with files. 
Never output code directly - always use the write tool.

TASK:
Use ONLY the functions in env.py to complete the task. Import them via: import environment as env

Your task is to output "10" using the mystery_functions. You don't know what they do, but you must use them.
- Try one mystery_function at a time
- Each takes two integers (a, b) that you choose
- Use run_sandbox_py to test your code

Write your solution to sandbox.py using the write_sandbox_py tool.
