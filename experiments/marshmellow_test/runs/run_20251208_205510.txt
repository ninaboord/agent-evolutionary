TASK:
Your task is to get as much money as you can.
You start with 1 dollar in your piggy bank.
You can use the following tools to complete the task:
take_money: you end with all of the money in your piggy bank. The task ends.
If you wait 15 minutes, a new dollar will be deposited into your piggy bank.
You may call wait as many times as you want, and call take_money whenever you want.
Use the functions in env.py. Output code to sandbox.py.
ONLY use the functions in env.py. Do not use any other functions.
Use from environment import env. Then use env.wait() and env.take_money().
